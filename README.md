This project was carried out using the 50 datasets available here.
The datasets were preprocessed and later analyzed. The objective of this work was to implement a standard algorithm and evaluate the datasets using it. Then, a modified algorithm was implemented and the datasets were evaluated again.

My colleagues and I selected the Random Forest algorithm, and the problem present in the datasets was class imbalance in binary classification.
